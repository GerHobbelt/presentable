# Presentable
## A Table of Contents for HTML Presentations

Presentable is a small script/plugin/widget/thingy that adds a table of contents to HTML based presentations.

### Framework Support
Reveal.js and html5slides are supported out of the box and Presentable can theoretically handle other frameworks, although your mileage may vary.

### Browser Support
Currently Presentable has been tested and works in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE9/10, and the default browser on my HTC G2 Android phone.
