# Presentable
## A Table of Contents for HTML Presentations

Presentable is a small script/plugin/widget/thingy that adds a table of contents to HTML based presentations.

Reveal.js and html5slides are supported out of the box and Presentable can theoretically handle other frameworks, although your mileage may vary.

Currently Presentable has been tested and works in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE9/10, and the default browser on my HTC G2 Android phone.

More details coming soon.
